# DL-PCImageGen

This repository is based on the works of @tommorse, specifically https://github.com/ModelDBRepository/218084, Whittington and Bogasz.

We aim to build a basic PC Network in order to then attempt the challenges proposed in "A Predictive-Coding Network That Is Both Discriminative and Generative" (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32795234/).
